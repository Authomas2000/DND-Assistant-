About the program:
I programmed this application to help my DM experience as no loot trackers were good enough for me to use on the spot. I added rarity
parameters and allowed combination of biomes, creatures, and other attributes, to make sure the loot matched what would be expected in those situations. No more "You kill a dragon and it drops a small gold statue".
